# Week 5 Write-Up

## Matthew

### Items Completed This Week

#### Experimentation, Coding and Implementation:

- Learnt how to use Keras: trained models on the MNIST, CIFAR10 and Ocado datasets (including re-training an InceptionV3 model and training a simpler CNN from scratch).
- Created 3D models (OBJ files and textures) of Ocado products.
- Used 3D models (two classes, Halloumi and Yogurt) to re-train InceptionV3-based model and tested model on data from the Ocado dataset - achieved 73% accuracy!!!

### Tasks for Next Week

#### Experimentation, Coding and Implementation:

- Keeping working on Keras to make it do more cool stuff!

### Time spent this week
- Keras: 10 hours (7 hours learning and 3 hours working on training on 3D models)
- 3D modelling: 2-3 hours
- Meeting: 2 hours

### Tasks on track?
- Yes
