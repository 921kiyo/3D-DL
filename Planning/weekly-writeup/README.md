# Weekly Write-up


## What is this?

Weekly write-up is used to keep record of our weekly activity and each member's contribution, which will be included in the logbook of the group project.


"Each member of the group should keep an individual record of how much time they spent and what they accomplished each week. A summary of all programming effort should be given in these records. Actual time spent per week for each member and work carried out should be noted in these records, and these individual records should be included in the logbook."

## Deadline

Every Friday 22:00 

(Kiyo will read everyone's write-up after 22 to manage everyone's workload).

## Things to write in the write-up

- What you did this week (what you accomplished, studied, did some experiments with etc.)
- What is your task next week
- How much time you spent this week
- All of your tasks on track? (if there is any problems, describe it)

Note that you do not include what we did together (e.g during meeting) in this write-up, as it is all recorded in meeting minutes. 

Then submit your write-up with your name in markdown file format in folders of each week. 

- e.g "kiyo.md" under week1 directory.
