## Tasks completed this week
- wrote single testing script with basic command line interface (-b to include blender, -t to include test files).
- script also does coverage and combines into a single report
- created testing branch on Gitlab and merged in tests (TODO: Ong's latest and Keras, and a final merging Sunday evening to generate coverage table for second report draft)
- got CI running with dependencies/overall coverage figure appearing in readme and installed Blender on test runner
- practice with Blender and wrote tests for BlenderNodes and BlenderLamp

## Tasks for next week
- Draft my sections of the report
- Add testing strategy comments to BlenderAPI tests
