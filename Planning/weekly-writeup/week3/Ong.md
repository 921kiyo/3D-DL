## Week 3 write-up

### Name: Ong

- What you did this week

	- Managed to secure an Agisoft licence, which enabled me to export meshes into Blender
	- Managed to set up Blender Node network in Python, for controlling Blender Mesh appearance (Texture and material properties)
	- Proof of concept: rendered 1000s of images of an imported mesh
	- Spotted and solved a problem with rendering: camera spin was not randomized, causing subject to always be tilted at a certain angle when viewed from a certain position.
	- Helped with experimenting with Kinect for 3D scanning
	- Refactored the Blender Library, which will be documented over the weekend
    

- What is your task next week

    - Analysing randomized parameters and making sure that it is correct
	- Look into randomizing more parameters (lighting intensities and introducing reflective surfaces?)
	- Document the Blender Library in preparation of takeover by assigned group members
	- Lay out specifications to test the Blender Library on
	- Look into refactoring tensorflow code with Kiyo and Swen

- How much time you spent this week

  - ca. 8 hours

- All of your tasks on track? (if there is any problems, describe it)
  - Yes
