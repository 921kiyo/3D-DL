# Week 6 write-up

## Max

## Tasks completed this week
- experimented with generating central documentation page
- more work on rendering script.
- got coverage.py working on all project modules. I have excluded build in/installed python libraries but still need to specify more files/folders to exclude (e.g. retrain.py)
- prepared outline for report 2
- set up a new test runner from GSC and got it talking to GitLab. I now have a basic continuous integration script running on a test repo and will set this up for Lobster once I have the dependencies sorted out (will do this weekend).


## Tasks for next week
- integrate our final list of files to test/skip into coverage.py and GitLab CI (this weekend)
- get coverage figure appearing on GitLab
- write tests for BlenderAPI

## Time spent this week
