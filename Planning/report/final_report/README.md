# Final Report (Report Three)
This detailed document will include your project specification, discussion of your implementation (technologies, design), your project logbooks and evaluation.

The contents of both Reports One and Two can be integrated into the Final Report. Your final report should include a specification and details of project management, e.g. schedule and progress. Do not include your source code in the report, other than possibly in outline fragments for the purpose of illustration (e.g. when you want to explain an algorithm you have used).

This section gives some suggestions for how you might structure your final report. The precise structure of your report will obviously depend on the particular project, so the items below are not binding, just suggestions. Note that Report One and Report Two should be able to provide a substantial part of the contents of the initial sections of your final report.

## Contents of Report Three
1. Introduction

A brief description of the topic and the problem you are setting out to solve.

2. Specification
Specification of the functionality that your project aims to provide. The contents of this section would normally be provided by Report One. In addition to that, explain whether you had to make any changes to the original requirements, and why (this may be taken from Report Two).

3. Design
This section should provide the overall design of your project. You should justify your main design choices and discuss other options you have considered.

4. Methodology
This section should describe the method you have used for solving the tasks described in your specification. How was the o verall task divided into different sub-problems? What were the intellectual and/or technical pro bl ems that had to be solved? What techniques did you consider using for solving the problem? Which did you choose and why? What software development techniques have you used to conduct your project? What was you r testing methodology, and what coverage is achieved by your current regression suite? Note that some of these issues would have been addressed in Report Two.

5. Group Work
Describe the division of work. This need not be a long story - just a brief statement of who did what. You may mention who has done what as you describe each section of the implementation (in section 3), however it is always a good idea to have a section summarising the division of work.

6. Final Product
Description of the final product you have produced, i.e. your overall achievement. What have you implemented? What have you not managed to implement? What were the difficulties: which did you manage to overcome, and how? Any novel results (this would apply more to investigative projects than to implementation projects)? Evaluation: How good is your product, how well does it perform, how accurately does it satisfy the specification?

7. Appendix
The appendix should contain your logbook, with records of group meetings, who did what, and, if possible, amount of time spent by various group members on their contributions (we realize that the latter might be hard to do precisely).

The report should be typed in Latex, and the main part (i.e. excluding the appendix) should be around 25 pages with 2cm margins all around, using an 11-point font with normal (single) line spa#cing. Given that you should already have about 10 to 15 pages worth of material from Reports One and Two, the task of writing the final report should be manageable. You can find a Latex template on CATE for your final report.

## What to Submit and When
You should submit:

- A full copy of the report on CATE; this will count as the official submission.
- An archive with your source code on CATE; the code should be properly documented and contain instructions on how to run it.
- Two hard copies of the report, one full copy (i.e. with appendices) and one copy of the main part of the report only (i.e. no appendices), to the Student Office. Mark them for attention of the Teaching Fellow for MCS.

## Presentation and Demonstration
In week 4 of the Summer term your group will give a presentation on your project which should include a demonstration of your software. Your supervisor will be present as will other groups (and your other group members) that are being assessed in your presentation session. You will be questioned about your software and expected to demonstrate its functionality.

Each group is allocated a 30 minute timeslot. This allows for 20 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of questions and another 5 minutes of turnaround time for the next group. Not everyone in the group has to present, but everyone should be prepared to answer questions. You can use any equipment available in the room, but it's your responsibility to make sure in advance that everything is working fine, and that the setup time is kept to a minimum.

You will be expected to attend the entire session in which your group is presenting (after all, everyone deserves an audience). If you are the first group in a session, please arrive at least 10 minutes before the start time of your presentation.
