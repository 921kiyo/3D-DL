# Group Projects HomePage

MSc Computing Science Group Projects run throughout term two and the spring holidays. They give MCS students experience of producing high quality software, often from scratch, in a team. Group projects build on the skills gained in term one but will also involve the acquisition of new skills for most students.

The Group Project is compulsory for everybody in MSc Computing Science and is integrated with the Software Engineering Practice course.

All project reports should be submitted online via CATE. Additionally, for the final report only, 2 hard copies should be submitted to the student office.

## Group Organisation
Groups will usually consist of 5 or 6 students. One person in each group will be elected as group leader. The group leader decides what route to take when there are different opinions among group members. Also, it is the group leader's responsibility to ensure that group members deliver what is required of them (e.g., submit the reports) and that they are on time. Normally, the group leader is in charge of the integration process when the various members' contributions are moulded into a single working ‘product’.

The group will also elect a documentation editor. The documentation editor has to keep a logbook containing the records of meetings and attendance of members. There should be a record after each group meeting of who agreed to do what and by when. It might also be a good idea to email these agreements to group members after each meeting. The documentation editor is also responsible for integrating documentation (usually provided by all members) into professional looking reports. The logbook should end with a summary giving the contribution to the finished product of each group member.

Each member of the group should keep an individual record of how much time they spent and what they accomplished each week. A summary of all programming effort should be given in these records. Actual time spent per week for each member and work carried out should be noted in these records, and these individual records should be included in the logbook.

## Assessment

Assessment of your project is by 3 reports and a final presentation and demonstration of your software. You will be assessed both on your success as a group and your individual performance. The marks are broken down as follows:

- Report One: 15%
- Report Two: 15%
- Final Report, Presentation & Demo: 70%
