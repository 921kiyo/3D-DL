\subsubsection{Software Engineering Requirements}

Development Approach

what resources (hardware and software) will be required

what techniques (e.g., which programming languages) you will use to implement the project

version control system we are using

the report should identify the development strategy chosen by your group (e.g., Scrum, XP programming) and how you are using it in the context of your project. You should include here information about the division of work.

\subsubsection{Minimum Viable Product}

what functionality you are setting out to provide with your final product

Please refer to the minutes from this Thursday

The report should clearly identify the requirements of the project using goal oriented-capture, categorize (essential vs. non-essential) and prioritize each requirement, assess their feasibility, decide on planned completion dates, and discuss the overall boundaries of your system
