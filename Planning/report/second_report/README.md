# Report Two
By the time of this second report, you should already have produced at least one ‘prototype’ of the project to provide you with an early feasibility-check on the overall integration of your system. During the time between your first and second reports different design approaches and technical solutions would have been discussed and tested such that by the end of this period the internal design details and technical approaches to solving the main problems become firm. Without knowing at this stage that the different parts of your technical work will definitely be able to interact with each other, you may struggle to get everything to work by the final deadline.

## Contents of Report Two
Report Two should discuss your project progress and your overall testing strategy. Relate your progress to the schedule you gave in Report One, and if necessary, provide a revised schedule for the remaining period. You may wish to elaborate on areas that have caused problems and how the group has adapted to solve the problems. If you have revised your specification you should include an update in this report.

Report Two should also discuss your testing strategy. Several lectures on the topic will be given in the Software Engineering course before this report is due.

You are required to use a coverage measurement tool and report the statement and branch coverage achieved in your code by your current test suite. You should write a summary of your coverage results in the actual report, and include more detailed information (e.g., screenshots produced by the coverage tool) in the appendix. You should ignore any third-party library code from your report. We expect your overall coverage numbers to be above 60% (but hopefully much higher). If it is the case, you should clearly justify why the coverage of certain modules is low and discuss the steps you plan to take to improve it.

Report Two should be between 3 and 5 pages (excluding the appendix) using an 11-point font size, with 2cm margins all around, and spaced normally. You are required to use Latex to type your reports.

Reports must be submitted via CATE by the deadline; no extensions will be granted.

## Report Two: Summary of Requirements
1. Should discuss any updates to your specification;

2. Should discuss your testing methodology;

3. Should include the coverage achieved by your current test suite (see above for details).
