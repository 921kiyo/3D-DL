This file was designed to contain all the necessary images for the training data generation.
The folders should contain:
objects: should contain one folder for each object, with respective files inside it (more information from Ong)
object_poses: will contain generated poses (generated by Ong's algorithm)
background_images: Is the background database of jpg images
resized_background: Database of background images resized so that the smaller dimension is identical to the dimension of the object image(currently 360 pixels)
final_images: The final training data, merges each object pose with a ranomd resized background

Each folder (apart from objects) should contain only the images specified, as the algorithm is carried out on every image in the folder.
